<style>
    .box {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
    }
    </style>

<!-- flex-direction: row-reverse
This sets the main access direction from right to left, which results in the flex items being placed from right to left. In the example below, you can see that the items are now placed in the reverse order. Item 1 is placed to the right: -->


    <div class="box">
          <div>1</div>
          <div>2</div>
          <div>3</div>
    </div>
