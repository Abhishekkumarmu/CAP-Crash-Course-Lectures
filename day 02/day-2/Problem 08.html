<!-- flex-direction: column-reverse
We also have column-reverse, which stacks the items in the reverse order. Look at the example below. You can see Item 1 is at the bottom and Item 3 is at the top: -->

<style>
    .box {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
    }
    </style>
    <div class="box">
          <div>1</div>
          <div>2</div>
          <div>3</div>
     </div>
