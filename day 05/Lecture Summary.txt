Lecture Summary

The lecture titled "CAP-60DAYS-Mastering Loops and Arrays in JavaScript" covered a wide range of topics related to arrays, objects, loops, and functions in JavaScript. Here's a summary of the key concepts discussed:

Objects and Arrays
Objects are used for storing information about a single entity with multiple properties.
Arrays are used for storing multiple objects, allowing for the organization and management of multiple entities.
Example:

let student = {name: "Name1", id: 01, subjects: ["Math", "Science"]};
let classroom = [];
classroom.push(student);
Functions and Method Chaining
Functions can be defined in various ways and can be reused to avoid code redundancy.
Method chaining allows for the application of multiple methods to an array consecutively.
Example of Method Chaining:

let newArray = array.filter(element => element > 5).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
Higher Order Functions and Callbacks
Higher order functions accept other functions as arguments or return functions.
Callback functions are functions passed into another function as an argument and executed within the outer function.
Example of Higher Order Function:

function calculator(num1, num2, operation) {
    return operation(num1, num2);
}

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

console.log(calculator(1, 2, add)); // 3
Map, Filter, Reduce, ForEach, and Sort
map returns a new array by transforming each element.
filter creates a new array with elements that meet certain criteria.
reduce reduces an array to a single value based on a provided function.
forEach executes a provided function once for each array element but does not return a new array.
sort organizes the elements of an array according to the specified criteria.
Example of Filter and Reduce:

let numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
let sumOfEven = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log(sumOfEven); // Outputs the sum of even numbers
Practical Use Cases
Throughout the lecture, these concepts were connected to practical use cases such as calculating the sum of certain elements in a cart or filtering products based on price, offering a comprehensive understanding of how to apply JavaScript functions and arrays to solve real-world problems.
